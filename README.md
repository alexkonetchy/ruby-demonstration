# RUBY-DEMONSTRATION
# ALEX KONETCHY

ruby-demonstration is a overall demonstration of my self taught skills in Ruby. The files specs were taken from Alex Chaffee and his work with App Academy. The files work with basic concepts in Ruby and class structure. You can see my work within the files contained in the lib folder.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask me. Thank you!n
